Hey there! Welcome to my To-Do List project. This isn't just another to-do app; it was a real adventure in building a full-stack application and getting it deployed to the cloud. It's built with a classic, solid stack: Node.js and Express on the back end, Handlebars to create the web pages, and a reliable MySQL database to make sure no tasks get lost.

The real goal here was to build something practical and then take it through the entire lifecycle, from running on a local machine to being live on the internet via Google App Engine.
